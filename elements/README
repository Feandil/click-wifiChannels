Those files describe three different elements. Here is a description of those elements

BasicOnOffChannel:
Filter packets according to the basicOnOff algorithm.
 * 1 PUSH Input
 * 1-2 PUSH Output: Packet that succeed go through 0, dropped packets go through 1
 * Options:
  - ERROR_CDF_FILENAME      : 'address' of the file containing the error cdf as generated by parseInput
  - ERROR_FREE_CDF_FILENAME : 'address' of the file containing the error free cdf as generated by parseInput
  - INITIAL_ERROR_PROB      : Initial probality error

MarkovChainChannel
Filter packets according to a MarkovChain
 * 1 PUSH Input
 * 1-2 PUSH Output: Packet that succeed go through 0, dropped packets go through 1
 * Options:
  - FILENAME : 'address' of the file containing the MarkovChain caracteristics as generated by parseInput

PrintBool
Print 0's and 1's depending on the port the packet went through:
 * 2 PUSH Input: 0 is for successful packets (print 1), 1 is for dropped packets (print 0)
 * 0 Ouput

You can also filter according to a basicMTA algorithm by combining the BasicOnOffChannel and the MarkovChainChannel by doing the following:
->BasicOnOffCHannel [0] ----------------------------> success
                    [1] -> MarkovChainChannel [0]  -> success
                                              [1] (-> drop)
