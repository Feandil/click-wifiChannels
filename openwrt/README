In order to have a working OpenWRT system:
- Go into a new directory
- Checkout svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/backfire
- Checkout svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages 
- Go into backfire/package
 * Run: for i in ../../packages/*/*; do ln -s $i; done
 * Create folders "libev" and "libev/patches" (in backfire/package):
  + Copy libev-Makefile for the git to libev/Makefile
  + Copy libev_patch_001-add-memory-fences.patch for the git to libev/patches/001-add-memory-fences.patch
 * Create folder "udp-test" and "utp-test/patches" (in backfire/package):
  + Copy Makefile for the git to utp-test/Makefile
- Go back into backfire/
 * Copy .config from git to .config
 * Recursively copy files/ from git to files/
  + Edit those configuration files as you want
 * Run "make". In case of errors, you can run "make V=99" instead, it will give more verbose output

In order to flash:
- Put the router in flash mode (plug the power cable while pushing "retore" until the light is blinking)
- Configure your ethernet port to use 192.168.1.2
- Go to backfire/bin/brcm47xx/
- Run: tftp 192.168.1.1
 * set "rexmt 1"
 * set "binary"
 * launch "put openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx"
  + The network ligth should be blinking during the transfert
  + Wait some minutes
  + Unplug and replug the power alimentation of the router
